Some users may find that they have no way to associate MAGNET urls (magnet://) links and torrent files (.torrent) with uTorrent client. 
Sometimes users can't select uTorrent in "Choose default apps by protocol" settings.

This file fixes this situation. Your browser (like Chrome) will open magnets links automatically.

1. Download the .reg file
2. Open it
3. Replace the path to your uTorrent.exe, don't forget to use double slashesh "\\\\"
4. Save the file
5. Merge edited .reg file with your registry
